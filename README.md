# Spot the Differences Game 
This is an assignment for my Image Processing class. This project contain 2 tasks:
1. Using images processing techniques to generate second images from the frist one
2. Solve the game

## Task 1
I code 3 programs, they are 3 ways to process images, 3 levels:
- Level 1: random some squares and adjust color
- Level 2: random some squares and flip horizontal
- Level 3: Find objects and adjust color.

## Task 2
Subtract one image to the other to find the differences.
